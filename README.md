## about my portfolio:

### planning: 

#### process / resources used
- mostly, playing around on https://lucid.app/ to see what sort of layout I'll go for
- read through most of https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/download-book/
- skimmed through  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae/

#### outcomes
- Here's a link to the layouts I've been playing around with: https://lucid.app/lucidspark/f97ea503-e397-4a8a-b05a-ca03dc5c5f6a/edit?viewport_loc=-950%2C-1325%2C4839%2C2300%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_fce4bb0d-9e97-4a25-ba77-34bbef6ac012

### tech stack
- React + Vite
  because this is what we've been practising recently, and it makes sense to keep doing so.
- JS
- CSS (planning to use Tailwind for that later)
  I'll go with what I've been taught for what I need to get done now, and I'll play around with framework on less time-sensitive projects
