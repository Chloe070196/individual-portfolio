## about my portfolio:

### planning: 

#### process / resources used
- mostly, playing around on https://lucid.app/ to see what sort of layout I'll go for
- read through most of https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/download-book/
- skimmed through  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae/

#### outcomes
- Here's a link to the layouts I've been playing around with: https://lucid.app/lucidspark/f97ea503-e397-4a8a-b05a-ca03dc5c5f6a/edit?viewport_loc=-950%2C-1325%2C4839%2C2300%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_fce4bb0d-9e97-4a25-ba77-34bbef6ac012

### tech stack
- React + Vite
  because this is what we've been practising recently, and it makes sense to keep doing so.
- JS
- CSS (planning to use Tailwind for that later)
  I'll go with what I've been taught for what I need to get done now, and I'll play around with framework on less time-sensitive projects
  
## Links

- portfolio gitHub repo - Going with https://github.com/Chloe070196/react-cohort-dashboard-challenge (which will be replaced later by a project I'm working on in my spare time), https://github.com/Chloe070196/react-address-book-part-2 (to be replaced later by the team dev project we'll work on in the second part of the course), https://github.com/Chloe070196/js-dom-brewery-tours-challenge (thought it might be worth including it since it is not a React project and therefore could show adaptability), and I'll also include the project I'll work on next week (does not have a repo yet). I'd also like to have a back-end project on there once we've covered that. So there should be 4 or 5 projects on there by the end of the course.
  
Since I'm planning on building project pages that walk the user through the project and highlights the more relevant / interesting bits, I might wait until I've actually got the projects I plan to include to start building those pages (I don't think what I'd make now could be used later).
